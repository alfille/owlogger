## ESP32

Basically the ESP32 can serve as an alternative to owpost.

The ESP32 family of chips has on-board wifi and GPIO pinds that can serve as a 1-wire bus master.

The device is not as powerful as a Raspbaerry Pi

* Minimal operating system (no Linux)
* Does not support owserver (or the owfs ecosystem)
* Uses a subset of python (micropython) which fortunatel;y covers our uses
* Lower power, lower cost
